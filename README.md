## ðŸš€ This project emphasizes semantic HTML and responsive design using BEM conventions. The clean and structured code ensures that users can easily modify it, making it ideal for open-source contributions and enhancing menu functionality. ðŸš€

### Semantic HTML5

### Flexbox

### Positioning

### BEM A custom form

### CSS animation and transform

### Iframe usage to add Youtube Videos

### Hover Affects

## Code Broke Down

### The form is to book a day and reservation to the Restaurant

### The menu was selected from Restaurants featured all over the USA from youtube

### The video clips show the 50 places around the USA and some of the dishes are from those

### One video is a recipe of a dish that will be featured or you can make at home

## Please reach out on our website to leave feedback on the food and experience or the social networks
